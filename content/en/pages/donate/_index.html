    <p>  <br>When the product you use is free, that often means you are indeed the product... The inverse of this means that we should probably be willing to pay to support the products we use in our daily lives, both for work and pleasure. This model that Google has created, where you ARE the product, is an incredibly dangerous and destructive one (think of all the data Google has on you, and how they use this data). All that said - to run this project costs money.  All such costs will be listed on a Transparency page - because we believe transparency is important. Whilst we hope to keep costs low, for those who can financially support us with a small donation, we would be very grateful. You can do so via the platform called Chuffed - which seems to be one of the better crowdfunding platforms out there.</p>  <p> Donate to DeGoogle  <br>Do you want to support to the DeGoogle project by covering our operating costs? If you can donate anything, we'd be very grateful! </p>  <p>Donate <br>https://chuffed.org/project/degoogle</p>
