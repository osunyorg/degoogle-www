    <p>Join the DeGoogle Webinar  <br>   <br>Every Friday at 1pm CET there will be a 30 minute webinar on how to DeGoogle. Below will be the link to join the next webinar (bookmark this page or add to your calendars!): (note - the link will be added here later ahead of the next webinar!). Upcoming DeGoogle Webinars:  <br> Friday 27th February at 1pm CET - Alternative Search Engines to Google  <br> Friday 6th March at 1pm CET - Alternative Web Browsers to Google  <br> Friday 13th March at 1pm CET - Alternative Email Providers to Gmail  <br> Friday 20th March at 1pm CET - Alternative Productivity Tools to G Docs  <br> The format will be casual, informative... people can drop in and out as they like. It will be made to be accessible to all types of tech users - beginners and beyond. The platform we will be using (for now) is Jitsi Meet. This feels most aligned with the movement - but we want to keep this flexible, and to be open to alternative platforms. We will try to ensure a recording is made available for those who can't make it.</p>  <p> Host your own DeGoogle webinar!  <br>   <br>If this movement is going to work, it will need as many people as possible to host webinars. This allows us to reach a wider audience, and (importantly!) ensures this is an inclusive movement which caters for all time zones. You don't need anything special to host a webinar - we can provide the basic training that you need to host one, and to help you to setup the hosting environment (we are using Jitsi Meet but there are other non Big-Tech options!). You can choose any topics to talk about too - for example:  <br> Finding alternatives to Gmail  <br> Finding alternatives to Google Drive  <br> Finding alternatives to Google Photos  <br> Finding alternatives to Android  <br> As long as it is related to de-googling, then it will be a relevant webinar and we will help to support and promote it! If you would like to host a webinar  please apply as a volunteer.</p>
