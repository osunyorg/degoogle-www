    Join Us On Element / Matrix
  summary: >-
    <p>You can now join us - and chat in real time - over on Element/Matrix.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>We are now active on the online chat and communication platform known as Element / Matrix. This is a decentralised and open-source communication tool which allows for safe and secure messaging between people looking to De-Google or shift away from Big Tech. We are using Element (built upon the Matrix.org standard) because it is the platform which is most aligned with the values and ethos of this movement.  We understand that this might be a new platform for people to use - so there might be a slight learning curve. It is worth sticking with - because otherwise we will be caving to the grip of the Big Tech monopolies! Sometimes things are worth persevering with, because they're worth it.</p>  <p> How to Install / Setup Element  <br>   <br>It is very easy to get setup with Element and Matrix.   <br>  Access our channel here:  https://matrix.to/#/#degoogle-now:matrix.org  <br>  <br>  Select Continue (Preview this link using the matrix.org homeserver...)  <br>  This is optional but we recommend you select the top option - Element (hit Continue).  <br>  Select the option to download (or Continue in your browser, if you know what you are doing!)  <br>  Run the installation prompt.  <br>  It should ask you to create a username/password for your account, to register.  <br>  Join us in the channel (if you need a reminder the link is listed in #1 above).  <br> I personally use Element within my browser having installed the software initially, but you can choose whatever works for you. There is also a nice mobile app if you prefer to access through Android or iOS. If you hit any issues just  reach out  for help!</p>  <p> How to Use Element (and a few House Rules)  <br>   <br>If you've ever used a tool like Slack, Discord or some other form of async comms platform, you will find the transition to Element very easy.  A few hints/suggestions:  <br>  If you want to become a volunteer, post to let us know in the channel you are in, and we will add you to the admin channel (which is hidden by default).  <br>  When responding to someone's post, try and use the "Reply in thread" button (which looks like a chat icon) so that conversations are kept neat-and-tidy, and easier for others to follow.  <br>  If comfortable, add a profile photo, so people can get to know you a bit better (using your own name is optional - I do but this is down to your personal preference).  <br>  We run on a privacy-first rule eg - don't screenshot and share messages outside of this channel without the explicit permission of anyone visible in the screenshot. This is general good manners, IMO!   <br>  If you want to suggest we do something - perhaps a new campaign or initiative - please don't be afraid to take control and suggest it to the group! We encourage people to be pro-active and to roll up their sleeves here. This is a decentralised movement in the sense that, everyone has equal power and say.  <br>  I personally like to disable notifications (except for "Mentions") otherwise it can get a bit overwhelming. Hit the notification icon on the left next to the room name, and switch to "Mentions and keywords".  <br> </p>  <p>   <br>Notification options in Element</p>  <p>   <br>Do you have suggestions on how to improve this page? Perhaps you have feedback on using Element/Matrix, or you want to suggest a new House Rule.  Send a  message  to share your thoughts (or post them directly in the Element channel!)</p>  <p>   <br>Element tech chat room <br>Image taken from  Element .</p>
