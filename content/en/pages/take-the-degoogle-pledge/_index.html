    <p>Take the DeGoogle Pledge - and Move Away from Supporting Google  <br>   <br>If your organisation feels strongly against aligning with Google - and wants to take back control of their data, and to support alternative, more ethical software solutions, then why not take the DeGoogle Pledge? This isn't just about taking back control - it is about joining a group of fellow minded people who also feel strongly that the internet would be a better place without the likes of Google and other forms of Big Tech. Here at DeGoogle we can help advise your organisation on how best to DeGoogle. From years of collective experience from people who have similarly DeGoogled on a personal and organisational level, our collective is well placed to help you to shift away from Google's products. </p>  <p> Get Help DeGoogling as an Organisation  <br>   <br>DeGoogling as an individual consumer is already hard enough - at an organisational level this complexity is multiplied several times. That isn't to say it's not possible (clearly, it is!) just that it requires a bit more time and thought.  The initial step is to create an audit of how your organisation is using existing Google Products in it's every-day running.  And then the task is to map these existing products to alternative solutions, creating a roadmap or action plan on making the transition. Finally, opening up new accounts, and migrating existing data and workflows across to their new alternatives, would be the final step. This is a super-quick topdown view of the process (there are some minor things missing) - but if you would like help with the above, we can assist. </p>  <p> Take the Pledge  <br>   <br>DeGoogle Organisation Pledge <br> Take the pledge to move away from using Google's products within your organisation - and take back control! Your name: Your email: Your organisation: We agree to commit to stop using Google's products within our organisation: We are willing to make our pledge public - to be listed on the DeGoogle.online website and in marketing materials <br> Why are you deciding to stop supporting Google within your organisation? How confident do you feel about making the switch, on a technical level? <br> Would you like to request help with the transition away from Google? <br> Any other thoughts/comments/feedback to share?</p>  <p> Share the Pledge  <br>   <br>The only way we can make DeGoogling more popular is by spreading the word.  If you are taking the pledge, why not share it on social media, or talk about it with colleagues and friends? Moving away from the clutches of Google, and taking back control, is an incredibly positive and powerful action you are taking. And we need to encourage more people to do the same!</p>  <p> A Badge for Social Media / Your Website  <br>   <br>Coming soon - download a badge to make use of on social media, or to add to your website footer.</p>
