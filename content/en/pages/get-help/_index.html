    <p>  <br>DeGoogling is HARD! We believe Google (and Big Tech) makes it like so on purpose. People don't have the time (or sometimes, knowledge) to be able to DeGoogle.  This is why we're offering free support to those people who have a specific use-case scenario and want to receive some additional tech support. Please be aware that we do plan on hosting webinars for common DeGoogling issues, for example: - How to shift away from Gmail (and which email provider should I move to?) - How to shift away from Google's Worksuite (and which alternative worksuites should I use?)  - And many more! So - if we think there may be a suitable webinar or resource we can share with you - we will do so. But otherwise we welcome specific requests for help.  This custom DeGoogle service might be ideal for small organisations, solo-freelancers and charities who lack the resources (and time) to be able to figure this out by themselves. Consider this as a pro-bono DeGoogle consultancy service - maybe if we are successful you will consider  making a donation  to support our operating costs, as a not-for-profit grassroots movement.</p>  <p>   <br>Form for asking for help DeGoogling. Fields are: Your name: Your email address: Brief summary your situation (eg moving from Gmail to Protonmail): Explain the issue and what help you are seeking. The more context you can provide, likely the easier (and quicker) we can help: If successful do you allow us permission to anonymously publish this on our website, to help document your journey and to help other degooglers?: If yes - are you ok if we use your name, or do you prefer to remain anonymous?: Any other thoughts/comments/feedback to share?:</p>
