    <p>  <br>I think we are required legally to have some form of privacy policy - but in our case (to our knowledge) we aren't tracking anything about you whilst you're visiting this website. We don't use tracking cookies (we don't like this form of web surveillance) whilst this could have meant the use of another data-harvesting Google product (Google Analytics).  So - we should be cookie free and the only data we might ask for is from those people who complete the LiberaForm as a potential volunteer - in which case any personal contact information is collected solely to respond to your request.  If you have questions about our privacy policy you can contact us on matt (at) degoogle.online</p>
