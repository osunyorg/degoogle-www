    <p>  <br>This is a movement for those people who are looking to move away from Google. I'm currently looking to find people willing to join and support this movement. I want to find other people who will be happy hosting webinars that help people to escape the clutches of Google. Ultimately this website will support anyone looking to shift away from BigTech and Google - and we will create guides that help you to make that switch. For now - please join the mailing list so you can receive updates. Reach out if you would like to become a webinar host - or to volunteer in some way - you can  send an email here . Thanks for your support!  </p>
