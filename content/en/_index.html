    <p>  <br>This is a movement for those people who are looking to move away from Google. I'm currently looking to find people willing to join and support this movement. I want to find other people who will be happy hosting webinars that help people to escape the clutches of Google. Ultimately this website will support anyone looking to shift away from BigTech and Google - and we will create guides that help you to make that switch. For now - please join the mailing list so you can receive updates.</p>  <p>   <br>Want to learn more about how to DeGoogle, or to support the movement? Drop your email below! <br>Become a DeGoogler <br> Start DeGoogling  <br>Are you ready to begin the DeGoogling process? Take action today and begin to plan your DeGoogle journey...</p>  <p>Start DeGoogling <br>https://start.degoogle.osuny.site/</p>
