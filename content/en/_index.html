    <p>  <br>Are you interested in learning how to shift away from the Google monopoly? Learn how to make the switch and support independent, ethical, privacy-first tools. The DeGoogle movement will be a people-powered campaign; I'm currently recruiting other volunteers and hosts - the plan is to run multiple workshops which walk people through the entire process of moving away from Google - helping them to transition to more ethical platforms.</p>
