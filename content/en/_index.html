    <p>  <br>This is a grassroots movement for those people who are looking to move away from Google. Maybe you're fed up with their monopolisation of the internet, or don't want to support another BigTech company that supports the genocide of the people of Palestine. Whatever your reasons, this site (and community) exists to support you to shift away from Big Tech, and towards more ethical, alternative, open source alternatives. I'm currently looking to find people willing to join and support this movement. We plan on hosting a number of webinars that will help people to make the switch - if you are interested in hosting one of these please do  apply as a volunteer . Later this website will also contain, and link out to, online guides that help you to make that switch away from the clutches of Google. For now - please join the mailing list below so you can receive updates on the project!</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Become a DeGoogler!</p>  <p> Want to learn more about how to DeGoogle, or to support the movement? Drop your email below!   There is a captcha verification and an email submit button.</p>  <p> We need volunteers!  <br>Are you willing to support the DeGoogle movement? All forms of support are welcomed - you can register your interest here.</p>  <p>Volunteer <br>https://degoogle.online/volunteer/</p>
